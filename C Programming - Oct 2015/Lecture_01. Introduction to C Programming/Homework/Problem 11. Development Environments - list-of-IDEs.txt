1. Visual Studio
Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. 
It is used to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, 
web applications and web services. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development 
platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store 
and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.

2. Eclipse
Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and 
an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, 
Eclipse can be used to develop applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse 
may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, 
COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby, Scala, 
Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematica. 
Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, 
Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.

3. Netbeans
NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, 
but also with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5. It is also an
