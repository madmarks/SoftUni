/*
 * Problem_12._Dot_Product_of_vectors
 * 
 * A Dot product of two vectors is a scalar which is a result of the sum of 
 * the product of each of the two vectorsâ€™ members. For example, if we have 
 * the vector [a1, a2, ..., an] and the vector [b1, b2, ..., bn], their dot 
 * product is: (a1b1 + a2b2 + ... + anbn). You are given the length n of each of 
 * the vectors on the first input line (In order to perform a dot product of 
 * two vectors, they have to be with equal dimensions). On the next n lines, 
 * you are given the members of the first vector, and on the next n ones, 
 * the members of the second one.
