How to convert binary to .deb:

   - Make a new folder _for_DEBIAN
   - Make directory DEBIAN inside of folder _for_DEBIAN
   - Then $ vi DEBIAN/control -> DEBIAN/control example file:        
        
        Package: polygon-calculator
        Version: 1.0
        Section: custom
        Priority: optional
        Architecture: all
        Essential: no
        Installed-Size: 8096
        Maintainer: nikto.net
        Description: Calculates perimeter and surface of given equilateral figure by given side and number of angles

   - Inside the directory _for_DEBIAN make directori usr/bin/
   - Then move the executable file polygon_calculator to usr/bin/
   - Go one level up from the directory _for_DEBIAN
   - dpkg-deb --build _for_DEBIAN
   - rename _for_DEBIAN.deb to polygon-calculator.deb
   - Then $ sudo dpkg -i polygon-calculator.deb
   - And finally $ polygon-calculator
   
   
Important:

 !!! sudo dpkg -P zip -> -P will remove everything, including setttings and configuration files.
   
 !!! apt-get is that it will install dependencies and dpkg does not
 
 !!! removal of dependencies does not happen with dpkg. apt-get does remove dependencies

   - sudo dpkg -i polygon-calculator.deb ->  install a local polygon-calculator.deb file
     
   - dpkg -L polygon-calculator -> To list the files installed by a package
   
   - dpkg -l | grep apache2 -> to see if a specific package is installed
   
   - dpkg -l -> To list all packages installed on the system
   
   - sudo dpkg -r polygon-calculator -> Uninstalling a package
     
 !!! Uninstalling packages using dpkg, in most cases, is NOT recommended. 
     It is better to use a package manager that handles dependencies to ensure that 
     the system is in a consistent state. For example using dpkg -r zip will remove 
     the zip package, but any packages that depend on it will still be installed and 
     may no longer function correctly.
